Welcome to the TimePlotGui! This library is intended to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing and manipulating data as the data is collected in real time.
The library was created for the Hoffman Physics Group at Harvard University but is broadly applicable to any project needing a GUI.

This GUI includes features such as the ability to adjust the display bounds, change the color and width of the plotted lines, and load previously saved data.
All of the functionality contained in the GUI is contained in the context menu, which is summarized in the "context menu functionality" section of TimePlotGui's [documentation](https://timeplotgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The TimePlotGui itself can be found for installation on [github](https://github.com/kehaus/time-plot-gui). the [python package index](https://pypi.org/project/TimePlotGui/).
